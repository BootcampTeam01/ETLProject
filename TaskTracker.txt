Reviewed Kaggle for interesting datasets 
Focused on baseball datasets
Decided to use https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank
Dataset included 23 different .csv files with data on baseball players, teams, and games from 1871 to 2015
Found there's a difference between years active (retire date - debut date) as players
do not play their total careers in the major leagues.
Salary information only available from 1985 forward.
Removed all data from pre-1985

Extract2:
Reviewed the mlb.com webpage for scraping opportunities
Set up Splinter to scrape team batting page

Transform:
For the baseball .csv files, we cleaned to remove data we were not going to use

Load:
Created etlprojectdb schema in MySQL
Loaded baseball .csv files into MySQL and joined the data to create a player snapshot: name, birthdate,
when they started, salary, etc.
